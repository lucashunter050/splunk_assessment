This repo contains an electron application that an access your Splunk enterprise deployment and process search queries.
Functionality is limited and unlikely to improve.

To build an executable for your system:
```cd splunk_assessment```

```npm run make```
If this command fails, you may need to run ```npm intall``` first.

```cd out/make/zip/darwin/arm64```

From here, you can unzip the .zip file and a desktop executable should be created.
